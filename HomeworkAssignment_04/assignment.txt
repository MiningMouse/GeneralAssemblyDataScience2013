Homework Assignment 

Create a logistic regression model using several independent variables. (40 points)

As with the linear regression exercise, you can pick your data set, but 

- It must be a new dataset you've never used before (10 points), and 
- You must include it with your submission or provide a URL where we can download it.

It should be a complete, self-contained script with the following features:

- An n-fold cross validation framework (20 points)
- Seeting a seed in the appropriate place (10 points)
- It's well commented, and has a brief description at the end about the trends you see (20 points)

Let me know if you have any questions about this!
